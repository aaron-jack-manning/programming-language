# Composite Types

Two composite types will exist, structs (product types) and variants (sum types). Declaration of these types will be as follows:

## Struct Type

```
type TypeName = {
    field1 : type1
    field2 : type2
}
```

## Variant Type
```
type TypeName =
    | case1 : type1
    | case2
```
