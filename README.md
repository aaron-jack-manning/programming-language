# Programming Language

This repository is a set of ideas, which will ultimately become a more thorough specification for a currently unnamed programming language which I plan on implementing when I have the time at some point in the future. The high level idea for the language is to have F# like syntax with C style memory management but with better support for polymorphism and some basic abstractions over C's unsafe features.

## TL:DR;

- Statically Typed: Yes
- Garbage Collected: No
- Whitespace Significant: Yes
- Type Inference: Yes (under certain circumstances)
- Classes and Objects: No
- Produces Standalone Executables: Yes

## Sample Programs

- [Hello, World!](samples/hello-world.txt)
- [Recursive Factorial](samples/recursive-factorial.txt)
- [Linked List](samples/linked-list.md)
- [For Loop](samples/for-loop.md)
- [While Loop](samples/while-loop.md)
- [Memory Allocation](samples/memory-allocation.txt)
- [Interfaces in Stdlib](samples/interfaces-in-stdlib.txt)
